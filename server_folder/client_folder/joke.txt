A software engineer walks into a bar and orders a beer. As they're sitting there, they hear a voice say, "Hey! Nice binary watch!"

The engineer looks around but sees nobody. They think nothing of it and continue drinking their beer. But then, they hear the voice again, "I really like it! Where did you get it?"

The engineer scans the room again, completely puzzled. Now they start to wonder if they're imagining things. But then, a voice whispers right in their ear, "It's very cool!"

The engineer freaks out and jumps up, spilling their beer everywhere. They frantically search for the source of the voice but find nothing. Just as they're about to call the bartender, they hear a tiny voice say, "Sorry, that was me. Still learning how to use echolocation."

The engineer looks down and sees a small bat hanging upside down from a nearby rafter. The engineer sighs with relief and says, "Oh, it's just a bat!"

The bat replies, "What did you expect? A talking parrot?"
